# IoT-Project

The following project aims to create a DIY Light Control device with several features by implementing several features on a programmable light strip with the use of sensors and programming them through a Raspberry Pi. 

Some of the features that the team is planning to implement include:

  1. Music synchronization on the strip according to the sounds being played in a room setting.
  2. User mode to choose between light and dark themes.
  3. Temperature detection and display using a display as well as the light strip.
  4. [OPTIONAL] A carbon monoxide detection system displayed by the means of the programmable strip.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS:

AYUSH SHRIVASTAVA:

Coordinate team tasks and meetings, assist in temperature sensor implementation, update github repository with up-to-date files as well as documentation and work on focussed areas for the project. 

CHUJIE MENG

Work on the action plan and results, keep track of project deadlines and make sure that the team is on track for its deliverables, assist in implementation.

WENYI CAI

Implement the temperature sensor physically on the Raspberry Pi and test the working on the programmable strip, provide visual aids for the report and create sample cases for bug detection.

YUCHAO YAN

Document major steps and create detailed notes for the entire implementation process, assist in feature testing, make sure that the required software and components are available to finish the implementation.
